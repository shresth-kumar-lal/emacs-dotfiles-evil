* Personal emacs configuration file with ideology to keep it simple and minimal.
+ Can be used on any system with emacs installed by just copying "init.el" file.
+ Vim keybindings by default.
+ Tested on emacs version 27+ however it should work on relatively older versions.
+ Firacode font is recommended
